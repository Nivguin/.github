# What is Nivguin?
Well to start, Nivguin is pronounced like this: Niv-g-win  
Nivguin is simply a name I use for different technical projects.  
Some of those projects under that name that I have worked on (Doesn't mean I finished them) are:
- Nivguin Mail
- Nivguin OS
- Nivguin Projects


# Niguin Projects
Nivguin Project is simply a project server for uploading projects to as an alternative to the PenguinMod project servers which are actively down.
It's also just a fun project for me to work on. Do not expect it to be always up; despite the fact that it will probaly be nearly always up I wouldn't count on it.
### How do I use it?
Currently it's a work in progress.
